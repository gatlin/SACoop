# Welcome

We are trying to start a [student cooperative][nasco] in San Antonio, Texas, a short distance from the [University of Texas, San Antonio][utsa] campus. The project has only just begun and we are still organizing and getting our proverbial ducks in a row.

If you would like more information, for now please send an email to <sanantoniocoop@nasco.coop>. There's much to do if you want to get involved!
