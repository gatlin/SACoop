title: What is a cooperative?
...

A housing cooperative is a group of people managing the property that they live in. You can think of it as "on-site management" where the residents do everything a property management company would normally do - collect the rent, answer maintenance requests, decide what to fix or upgrade, etc.  The residents run the place the way that they, as a group, want it run.

In a more general sense, a cooperative (or co-op) is a group of people who work together for their common benefit. Cooperatives aim to give people control and responsibility over their own lives. They are communities which value equality, democracy, and freedom.

In most housing cooperatives members eat together, meet regularly, and perform labor. By doing this you remove the need to rent your life from someone else: it's *your* house and *you* take care of it.

# Labor

Labor is the work done to maintain the property: cooking, cleaning, fixing, building, growing, and helping. Labor has to happen to make co-operatives work, and all members participate in the labor system.  Many cooperatives assign labor based on preferences and skills and have ways to keep everyone accountable for their responsibilities. Labor is also a fantastic way to learn new skills.

# Equality

In many cooperatives, there are two kinds of members: those who *live* in the cooperative, and those who just *eat* at the cooperative, and they pay different membership fees. As of right now we haven't decided all the different classes of membership we'll have. **One thing is for certain**: all of them get equal votes and equal say in the community.

# The Rochdale Principles

There are seven simple principles which define a cooperative, and how they apply to our new house. 

1. Voluntary and open membership.

    Cooperatives are open to anyone who is willing to accept the responsibilities of membership. We do not discriminate, period. Different houses have different systems for accepting new members but the common theme is that if you are willing to make the effort then your race, religion, country of origin, native language, hair color, clothing, and abilities are welcome to join.

2. Democracy.

    In a cooperative, every member gets a say in house policy and what happens with house resources. There are many different ways for this to work, but above all a cooperative is democratic.

3. Member economic participation.

    Money talks. In a cooperative, the members pay for the property. As a result, the members are the ones who own and control the property. **You** own it and **you** get to decide what you want out of it. No landlords, no "rent"[^1] Cooperators are homeowners, plain and simple.

4. Autonomy and Independence.

    Your cooperative decides what it wants for itself, sets its own rules, and governs itself. Where you buy your food from, who you ally with and support, and what you do at your house is your business and your decision. You are not coerced into believing or doing anything beyond following the law.

    The Gault property is one of two properties in a cooperative called Community Housing Expansion of Austin (CHEA). The other house is [Sasona](http://sasona.org). CHEA exists to help coordinate matters between the houses so that they are operating legally and are financially stable. CHEA does not get a say in house policies or culture for either property, and it is not "above" either property.

    The property itself is owned by [NASCO Properties](http://www.nasco.coop/properties/) (NP), which is itself a cooperative! CHEA sends a member to sit on the NP Board of Directors. NP helps to start cooperatives across North America and assist with legal and financial matters so that we don't all have to be lawyers and accountants and can focus on living in and growing the house.

5. Education, training, and information.

    Cooperation is about empowering people. Education is the key to empowerment and cooperatives make it a point to provide educational value to their members. Many coops are community centers as well, hosting free classes and seminars on topics the community finds interesting.

    But cooperatives are educational in other ways. In houses with 20, 40, or even 100 people - and many of those exist in Austin alone - you can learn a lot just by living with the other members. Doing labor teaches you how to cook for lots of people, or how to fix mechanical problems, or how to garden, or how to run a meeting, or how to speak in public, *et cetera*. These skills are useful no matter where you live; they can make you more independent and save you money.

6. Cooperation among cooperatives.

    A cooperative is a group of people who come together to help each other; cooperatives also try to help each other as organizations. For example, the house on Gault Street is a 10 minute bike ride from Black Star Pub and Brewery, a cooperative pub owned by its workers and customers. Black Star was created with help from College Houses and ICC, cooperative organizations for students next to the UT campus. Cooperation Texas is another cooperative dedicated to starting cooperative businesses, such as the Red Rabbit bakery or Green Dahlia cleaning services.

7. Concern for community.

    Cooperatives are not simply about helping their members: they aim to help the community surrounding them, too. We want to take the benefits we get from cooperation and pass them along to as many people as we can. Through education, democracy, economic control, and autonomy, we want to make life better for everyone.

[^1]: However, you might hear people refer to their monthly dues as "rent" out of habit. It is after all a very simple word that anyone can spell, and people know what you mean. It should be made clear though that what you are paying are membership dues, not rent.
